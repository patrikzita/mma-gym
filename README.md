# Project Overview
This project was embarked upon with the primary goal of learning and mastering TailwindCSS. In the course of this project, I discovered that TailwindCSS is arguably one of the best styling methods available. Its unique approach of writing CSS directly into HTML or JSX proved to be very comfortable and efficient, making it a preferable choice over other styled component libraries such as React-Bootstrap and Material UI.

## Why TailwindCSS
Given the experience garnered from this project, I would definitely consider TailwindCSS as my first choice for building a website where aesthetics are a priority. In such a case, I might also consider leveraging the paid version, Tailwind UI, for more extensive options.

## Project Features
This project focuses mostly on frontend development, showcasing my abilities to create basic features such as a shopping cart, Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) implementations, among others.

## Server Simulation
In the interest of time, and with upcoming interviews in view, I simulated a server using JSON-Server for this project. This, however, doesn't rule out the possibility of adding a server-side in the future. However, my focus would be more on real-world projects that add value to the world.

## Reflection and Future Improvements
Looking back, if I were to undertake this project again, I would definitely employ Next.js for the task. Based on my current knowledge and experience, Next.js seems to be the best choice for such projects.

## How to Use This Project
To set up and run this project, follow the steps below:

Install the required dependencies by running `npm install`.

Navigate to the client directory by entering `cd client`.

Start the development server by executing `npm run dev`.

In a separate terminal, start the JSON-Server using the command `json-server --watch server/db.json`.

# Conclusion
This project has been a great learning journey for me, and I am excited about the new skills I have acquired. I look forward to using these in future projects and continually improving my abilities.
