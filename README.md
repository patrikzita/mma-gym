# Project Overview
This project was embarked upon with the primary goal of learning and mastering TailwindCSS. In the course of this project, I discovered that TailwindCSS is arguably one of the best styling methods available. Its unique approach of writing CSS directly into HTML or JSX proved to be very comfortable and efficient, making it a preferable choice over other styled component libraries such as React-Bootstrap and Material UI.

## Why TailwindCSS
Given the experience garnered from this project, I would definitely consider TailwindCSS as my first choice for building a website where aesthetics are a priority. In such a case, I might also consider leveraging the paid version, Tailwind UI, for more extensive options.

## Project Features
This project focuses mostly on frontend development, showcasing my abilities to create basic features such as a shopping cart, Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) implementations, among others.

## Server Simulation
In the interest of time, and with upcoming interviews in view, I simulated a server using JSON-Server for this project. This, however, doesn't rule out the possibility of adding a server-side in the future. However, my focus would be more on real-world projects that add value to the world.

## Reflection and Future Improvements
Looking back, if I were to undertake this project again, I would definitely employ Next.js for the task. Based on my current knowledge and experience, Next.js seems to be the best choice for such projects.

### Design Limitations
One of the known limitations is the design of the website. The design aspect of this project was partly improvised due to working on four projects concurrently and not having a specific design template at hand. This experience has provided valuable insight into my workflow, making me realize the drawbacks of working on multiple projects simultaneously. Going forward, I would avoid this type of multitasking as it often leads to distraction and affects the quality of work produced.

### Project Structure
The project structure was specifically designed to cater to each component in its own folder. This was done in anticipation of adding tests in the future. Although this might seem overwhelming for a small-scale project, it allows for better maintainability and scalability for larger and more complex projects.

### Future Enhancements
If I were to further enhance this project in the future, apart from adding a real server-side, I would also undertake a thorough review and cleaning up of the existing codebase. This would improve the overall quality and readability of the code.

Additionally, for better performance and efficiency, I would load images from a Content Delivery Network (CDN). For improved communication and typing, I would employ the use of tRPC, a modern framework for building APIs in Node.js, just like gRPC, but without the proto files.

This project, as it stands, was a great learning journey. The known limitations and future enhancements serve as a stepping stone for continuous improvement and learning. Each project is a step forward, and I am excited about the opportunities to improve and refine my skills with each new project.

## How to Use This Project
To set up and run this project, follow the steps below:

Install the required dependencies by running `npm install`.

Navigate to the client directory by entering `cd client`.

Start the development server by executing `npm run dev`.

In a separate terminal, start the JSON-Server using the command `json-server --watch server/db.json`.

# Conclusion
This project has been a great learning journey for me, and I am excited about the new skills I have acquired. I look forward to using these in future projects and continually improving my abilities.
